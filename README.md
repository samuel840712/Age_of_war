# Age_of_war (Board Game)

It is a boardgame to attack castles.
The rule is:
First you roll the dices(7 dices). Then, you choose a castle that you want to attack. Every castle has their condition to do. So, you must match its conditions.
When you totally match its conditions, you can occupy the castle.
There are some tips:
If you want to attack other people's castle you will have one more condition which is matched the extra-general. 
When you want to match its conditions, you only can match exactly 1 row except extra-general and after that you can roll the dices again and match another conditions.
If you match above 1 row, then you cannot roll dices again. So, you need to put the dices to origin place.
If you do not match any row, you will get punishment and subtract one dice when you roll the dices next time.
It is a good way to collect a family(same color) because other players cannot attack their castles.
When you run out of dices and didn't occupy the castle, it will turn to the next player to play the game.
When all the castles are occupied by players, then the game stop and players can calculate their scores.
Who get the best scores will get the championship.
